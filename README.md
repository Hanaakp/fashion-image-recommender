# fashion-image-recommender
An unsupervised fashion image recommendation system using deep learning and Streamlit, that suggests visually similar fashion items based on an uploaded image. It uses a pre-trained ResNet50 model to extract visual features from images and applies k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to find and display similar items.
